When I first started to watch this lecture I saw that it was an hour and fifteen minutes long and thought to myself oh no. But by the fifteen minute mark I was hooked. I agreed with many of his points along the way. “Get the fundamentals down.” This point stuck with me because it is so true in almost every aspect of life. You have to learn how to walk before you can run. If you can't get the fundamentals down first there is no way you will be able to excel into the more complicated things. “Experience is what you get when you don't get what you wanted.” This quote stuck out because experience is something that can not be taught. It's something that you have to conquer yourself. It shows that failure is something to learn from not dread. “The brick wall stops the other people”. I felt this quote because many people are quick to give up the first wall they hit. It's important to keep trying even when you do not see the light at the end of the tunnel. Where most people turn back is where you should gain the motivation to keep pushing. The last quote that really stuck with me is “Give people enough time and they will almost always surprise you.” My dad told me from a very young age to never judge a book by its cover. This correlates with a lot more than just books. There are multiple people in my life that I was not fond of at the beginning of our friendship. But as time went on I could see through their outer shell and began to realize how amazing these people really are.
