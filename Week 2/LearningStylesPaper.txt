Some of this article talks about how some people think they have specific learning styles but do not actually stick to them. Through my experience I do not agree with this. I think everyone has their own way of learning that works best for them. For example I have always been a visual learner and continue to stick to these ways. But my friend is a reading/ writing learner. If we switched learning styles for a week I know for a fact the results would be visible. In the end I think the best way to learn is hands-on experience.
