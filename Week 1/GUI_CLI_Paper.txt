A Graphical User Interface is a way of interacting with a computer using visual elements like icons, buttons, and menus. Itâ€™s great for beginners because you can click on things instead of typing commands. GUIs are common in everyday operating systems like Windows and macOS.

A Command-Line Interface on the other hand, requires you to type many text commands to perform tasks. It can be harder to learn, but it's also powerful and efficient for people who are comfortable with it. Many developers and system administrators often use CLIs because they can perform tasks faster and automate processes.

GUIs are user-friendly and good for general tasks, while CLIs offer more control and speed, especially with advanced users. The choice between the two depends on what you need to do and how comfortable you are with technology.
