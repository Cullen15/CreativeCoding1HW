# Final Project Proposal – Maze Game 

## Project Title  
**Escape Loop**

## Project Description  
For my final project, I'm going to build an expanded and polished version of the maze game I created earlier in the course. This new version, titled *“Escape Loop,”* will have multiple levels with an increase in difficulty, enemy characters that patrol parts of the maze, reactive sound effects, and improved character controls.

The player will navigate through each maze, avoiding enemies and trying to reach an exit to progress. Each level will have its own visual style and might include unique mechanics or obstacles depending on what I can figure out. The goal is to create an engaging and challenging game that maintains player atension while also encouraging exploration and well thought out movement.

## Inspiration and Related Works  

- “My original maze game” – I enjoyed designing the layout and navigation mechanics and now want to deepen the gameplay experience by adding more challenge and immersion.  
- **Classic arcade games like Pac-Man and Bomberman** – Inspired by the idea of enemies that move along fixed paths or chase the player.  

## Technical Challenges and Research Needs  
- “Level design system” – Creating a way to store and load multiple levels.
- “Enemy AI” – Programming enemy logic for patrolling or chasing the player.  
- “Collision detection” – Collision systems for player and enemy interactions.  
- “Sound integration” – Implementing `p5.sound` for interactive audio.  


## Work Plan & Internal Deadlines

| Week | Goals | 

| Week 1 | Create new maze level layouts, build base structure in p5.js with player movement 
| Week 2 | Add enemy AI logic, program collisions, begin level switching mechanics |
| Week 3 | Add sound effects, hopefully good graphics, finalize overall game loop |

## Work Completed This Week  
- Sketched new maze designs and planned 3 potential levels.  
- Researched enemy movement patterns.  
- Started a basic level loader system.
